# TPMonopoly
Project Description: 
My project is a basic two player monopoly called Monopoly Lite.
The game will include the normal rules of monopoly but some rules 
will be simplified for clarity, such as the rent is going to be a 
percentage of the cost to buy the property and player will be able to buy 
each other’s property at twice the price (if there isn’t a house/hotel on it), instead of the normal negotiation between players. 

How to run the project: Run the "main.py" file in the editor.

No libraries needed.

Shortcut Commands:
Press "r" to restart after the game ends.

Press "e" to end the game. **This is will make the current player go bankrupt

Press "h" to go back to the home screen. If you do this, the game will restart

Press "v" to have player 2 own all the properties. This is the shortcut way 
to test the ability to buy houses.

Press "y" to have player 2 own three houses on all the properties. This is the
shortcut way to test the ability to buy hotels.
