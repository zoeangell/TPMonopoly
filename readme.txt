Project Description: My project is a basic two player monopoly called Monopoly Lite. The game includes the normal rules of monopoly but some rules are simplified for clarity, such as the rent is a percentage of the cost to buy the property and the players can buy each other’s property at twice the price (if there isn’t a house/hotel on it), instead of the normal negotiation between players. The game ends when one player goes bankrupt.
