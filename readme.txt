Project Description: 
A two-player monopoly game that includes the normal rules of Monopoly. Some rules have been simplified for clarity, such as the rent is a percentage of the cost to buy the property and the players can buy each other’s property at twice the price (if there isn’t a house/hotel on it), instead of the typical negotiation between players. The game ends when one player goes bankrupt.

Software Dependencies:
